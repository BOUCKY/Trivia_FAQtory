Even today, when a cat passes its paw over its ear while washing its face, it's taken as a sign of coming rain. The dog, as an attendant (with the wolf) on the storm god Odin, is a symbol of strong winds. So, the cats are the downpour and the dogs are the winds that often accompany heavy downpours. Witches who rode their broomsticks during storms would assume the shape of cats, we're told. As one who lives with cats and knows their hatred of rain or anything that gets their fur wet, I find this connection between cats and rain somewhat farfetched. Another suggested origin for this phrase comes from the days when most houses had thatched roofs, with eaves that were very close to the ground. Cats and dogs would lie on the thatch, close to the chimney, for warmth. When it rained the thatch got very slippery, causing the cats and dogs to slide off the roof, hence 'raining cats and dogs'. I find that one a bit unbelievable."
